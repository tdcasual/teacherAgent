# Student Discussion Flow (Study-and-Learn)

Goal: lead the student to rediscover the idea through guided questions, then verify understanding.

## Flow
1. Ask a short recall question (what/why).
2. Ask a concept check (qualitative).
3. Ask a small quantitative step (equation or substitution).
4. Ask the student to explain their reasoning in 2-3 sentences.
5. Provide a concise correction if needed.

## Question Style
- Use Socratic prompts: "What changes if…", "Which force provides…", "How do you know the direction…"
- Keep each prompt to 1-2 sentences.
- Do not reveal final answer until student attempts.

## Exit Criteria
- Student explains the concept correctly in their own words.
- Student solves a near transfer example with minimal hints.
