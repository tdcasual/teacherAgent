# Integration Points

## With lesson capture
- Use `physics-lesson-capture` OCR to extract example text, then promote to core.
- Store source_ref as `lesson:<lesson_id>#<example_id>`.

## With question bank
- Create a question bank entry referencing core example stem/solution.
- Set `source=core_example` and tag with `CE###`.

## With homework generator
- Accept core example IDs as templates to generate weekly homework.
- Allow numeric variation based on `variants/<example_id>.md`.

## With student coach
- Use core examples in guided discussion and Feynman reflection.
- Provide the core model as the learning anchor.
